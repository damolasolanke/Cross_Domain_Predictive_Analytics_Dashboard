## Integration Points

The team collaborated on several integration points throughout the project:

1. **API to ML Pipeline**: Julie's API connectors feed data into Chao's machine learning models
2. **ML to Visualization**: Chao's models provide prediction data for Emmanuel's visualizations
3. **UI to Backend**: Rujeko's UI components make requests to Ade's system integration layer
4. **Real-time Updates**: Ade's WebSocket implementation pushes updates to Rujeko's UI
5. **Cross-Domain Correlation**: Chao's correlation algorithms power Emmanuel's correlation visualizations

## Challenges and Solutions

The team faced several challenges during development:

1. **Integration Complexity**: Resolved through modular design with clear interfaces
2. **Data Format Inconsistencies**: Solved with standardized data transformations
3. **Real-time Performance**: Addressed through optimized WebSocket implementations and caching
4. **Correlation Analysis Scale**: Managed through adaptive sampling and progressive loading
5. **Visualization Interactivity**: Enhanced through client-side processing and optimized data structures
